    <h2>Weaver Warriors take down the Orienta Orioles 39-26. </h2>
    <p>The Orienta Orioles were missing the reigning MVP Aidan Roy in this game, and it showed. They struggled to generate offense, although Nate Bard had a solid performance with twelve points and 9 rebounds. Julian Epstein played a great game, but unfortunately it was cut short with 3 minutes left to play as he injured his ankle. It looks like he will be out for a few weeks. We all wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
